A wifi based EGT, CHT, RPM, Speed monitor board. Works on 6vac and 12vac systems. No need for a battery. It works with iOS and android, or really anything with wifi. The goal is to keep the size reasonable and the total build price under $25. It is based around the ESP8266 wifi SoC. RPM is calculated off the AC from the stator, using an NCV1124 for zero crossing. The EGT is a Ktype thermocouple and the CHT is a TrailTech. The EGT and CHT signals are converted using an ADS1120 ADC SPI device. To make it easy to modify, I'm doing all the firmware in Arduino.
